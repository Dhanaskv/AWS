what is cloud computing ?
AWS cloud computing provides a on-demand delivery of servies through internet  with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying,owning and maintaining the physical data centers and servers.

Types of cloud computing ?

1) IaaS ( Infrastructure as a service )
      IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. They provides a networking features, computers, data storage 
      ex : AWS
       
2) PaaS ( Platform as a service )
      PaaS removes the need for underlying infrastructure( usually hardware and operating systems ) and allows you to focus 
      on deployment and management of your applications.
       
3) SaaS ( Software as a service)
       SaaS provides you with complete product that is run and managed by a service provider. Web based email is the example for SaaS. 
       We don't think about how the service maintained or how the underlying infrastructre is maintained. you only need how to use that particular software
        Ex : Email, O365




Amazon EC2 provides a scalable computing capacity in aws cloud
amazon ec2 eliminates you need to invest in hardware upfront
so you can develop and deploy appliation faster
you can use amazon ec2 as many or few virtual servers as your need,configure security,manage storage.
=========================================================
#Features of AWS:
Virtual Computing environments Known as Instances
preconfigured templates for instances
various configurations cpu,memory, storage and networking capacity for your instances,known as instance types.
secure login information for your instances using key pairs(aws stores public key and you store the private key)
persistent storage volumes using amazon elastic block storage
A firewall enable protocols,ports and source ip ranges using security groups
Static IPv4 addresses of dynamic cloud computing such as Elastic IP address
==============================================================
what is instance?
Instance is a virtual server in aws cloud..with amazon ec2 you can setup and configure the operating system and applications run on your instance
