Amazon S3 is the one of the main building blocks of AWS
It advertised as "Infinitely scaling" storage.
Many websites use amazon S3 as a backbone
Many AWS services uses amazon S3 as an integration as well

Amazon S3 allows people to stores objects (files ) in buckets ( directories )
Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts ) 

S3 Security 
 1) User Based
      IAM Policies - Which API calls shoulb be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
 2) Resource Based
      Bucket policy - directly rules attached to s3 buckets to allow or deny requests from other accounts or public access so on
 3) Encryption 
      encrypt objects in amazon s3 using encryption keys
      
      
      
 JSON based policies :
       1) Resources : objects and buckets 
       2) Set API to allow or deny 
       3) Effect : allow or deny
       
 S3 websites :
       1) S3 can host static websites and have access them on www
       
 S3 Versioning :
       1) you can version your files in amazon S3
       2) It is enabled bucket level
       
 S3 access logs :
       1) For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
       
  S3 Replication :
       1) We can enable replication for extra buckets
       2) Must enable versioning source and destination 
       3) Cross region replication or same regoin replication
       
  Storage classes :
       1)amazon S3 standard - general standard
       2)amazon S3 standard - Infrequent access
       3)amazon S3 one zone - Infrequent access 
       4)amazon S3 glacier instant retrieval
       
  S3 object lock & Glacier lock 
       1) adopt WORM (write once read many )
       2) block an object version deletion for specific amount of time
     Glacier lock
       1) adopt WORM (write once read many ) 
       2) We can create lock policy that prevent future edits for that file
