Scalability means that  system / an application can handle greater loads by adapting 
There are two kinds of scalability in the cloud 
           1) Vertical Scalability ( Increasing size of the Instance )
           2) Horizontal Scalability ( Increase the number of instances or systems for your application ) 
                  --> It implies  distributed systems
                  
                  
                  
 High Availability -- HA means running your application/ system in atleast 2 availabity zones
 
 
 Load Balancer - Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple EC2 instances downstream
 why load balancer - 1) Spread load across multiple downstream instances
                     2)Seamlessly handle failure of downstream instances
                     3)Do regular health checks to your instances
                     
  Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer 
  AWS takes care of upgrades maintanence and high availabity
  three kind of load balancers offered by AWS
  1) Application load balancer
  2) Network load balancer
  3) Classic load balancer
  
  ASG - ( Auto Scaling Group )
     -- The goal of ASG is to :
                1) Scale out ( add EC2 instances to match an increase load )
                2) Scale in (remove EC2 instances to match an decrease load )
